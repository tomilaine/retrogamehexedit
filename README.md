(Placeholder) Hex editing for old retro games. 

I rarely play any games nowadays but if I do, it's some older DOS or Amiga games. While playing normally might be fun, I also love how easy it is to hexedit the games or saves (just like I did back in the day).

The investigative work on what can be edited is as much fun as the end result but having done the same work several times already with some games, I started to feel maybe I should actually store the findings and results somewhere. Therefore this repo.

I'm not sure if I end up actually writing any code for automation or UI. Meanwhile, I'll just use this as a placeholder to make notes of particular save game formats and other fun edits. Don't expect much activity from me but if this topic interests you, feel free to collaborate or give me ping.
